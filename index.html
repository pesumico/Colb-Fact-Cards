"Colb Asset SA is based in Geneva, Switzerland.",
"Colb was founded (or at least operating) from 2020 onward, focused on bridging traditional finance with blockchain.",
"The company specialises in tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs) making institutional-grade investments available via blockchain.",
"Their stablecoin, originally named “USD Stable Colb ($SCB)”, was renamed to $USC (Colb USD) and is pegged at 1:1 to the USD.",
"$USC is fully collateralised by cash and cash-equivalents (including U.S. Treasury bills) and is issued in compliance with Swiss law.",
"The tokenisation framework used by Colb is called TKSP (“Tokenized Structured Product”), which allows non-custodial, on-chain ownership of premium/large-scale assets.",
"Colb’s platform emphasizes non-custodial ownership of digital assets meaning users hold assets in their wallets rather than through intermediaries.",
"Colb is a member of ARIF (Swiss self-regulatory organisation approved by FINMA) and acts as a financial intermediary under Swiss regulation.",
"The reserve assets backing $USC are held in a bank account in Switzerland, in a legal trust structure designed to protect against bankruptcy or misuse.",
"Colb has raised capital in seed/extension rounds; for example, an oversubscribed round of approx CHF 6 million (~USD 7.3 million) was announced to support infrastructure and asset tokenisation.",
"Colb partners with other blockchain / DeFi infrastructure platforms; for example, the partnership with Moonbeam Foundation and the Moonbeam network to deploy $USC on its mainnet and support RWAs.",
"Colb also partnered with Plume Network (or Plume) to bring tokenised pre-IPO equities on-chain expanding access to private market share certificates.",
"The company’s tokenisation framework (TKSP) is flexible enough to accommodate multiple asset classes (funds, pre-IPO equity, institutional strategies), not just simple tokenised assets.",
"Colb’s governance/utility token is called $COLB, which plays a role in secondary market infrastructure, aligning liquidity providers and investors.",
"According to their whitepaper, the minting and burning of $USC are tied directly to fiat deposit and withdrawal flows, and the total supply of $USC should always be backed by the reserves held.",
"The platform is designed with interoperability e.g., deployable on EVM-compatible chains and integrating with DeFi rails.",
"Colb targets both “crypto natives” and traditional investors by offering access via wallet or email and aiming for global access.",
"Their investment focus includes growth sectors, including infrastructure, energy, agribusiness and utilities sectors traditionally available only to institutional investors.",
"The company emphasises transparency: the reserves and issuance/burning mechanisms are auditable, and the legal structure is made to isolate the trust’s assets from counterparty risk.",
"Colb’s offering is currently available to qualified investors only and is not promoted to U.S. persons or in restricted regions (as per their regulatory disclosures)."
